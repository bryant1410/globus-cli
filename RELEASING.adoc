Releasing a Version
-------------------

To perform a release, the following steps should be followed:

Setup:

  - Make sure you have a pypi account
  - Setup your credentials for twine (the pypi upload tool)

  - Make sure you have a gpg key setup for use with git.
      https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work[git-scm.com guide for detail]

Do it:

  - update the version in `src/globus_cli/version.py`
  - `make prepare-release` to update version and changelog
  - Add and commit the result with
    `git commit -m 'Bump version and changelog for release'`
  - `make release` to build dists, upload via twine, and tag the release
  - push the newly created version tag to GitHub
  - Create a GitHub release with a copy of the changelog
  - Ensure that `docs.globus.org` gets updated with new docs/changelog
      Procedure is set in that repo.

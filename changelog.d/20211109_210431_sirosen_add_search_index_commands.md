### Enhancements

* Add a new `globus search index show` command which displays an index by ID
* Add a new `globus search index list` command which lists indices for which
  the current user has permissions
* Add a new `globus search index create` command which creates a new Globus
  Search index. Note that because the index creation API is in public beta, the
  command is also labeled as "beta"
